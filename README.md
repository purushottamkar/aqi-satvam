# Robust statistical calibration and characterization of portable low-cost air quality monitoring sensors to quantify real-time O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations in diverse environments
This repository presents an implementation of the distance weighted k-nearest neighbors algorithm with a learnt metric (KNN-D(ML) for short) for the purpose of calibrating Alphasense sensors measuring atmospheric O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations. The repository also presents some comparitive and ablation studies. The accompanying paper can be found at [[1]][ref1]

## Setup

### Installing Python Library Dependencies

Our implementation of the KNN-D(ML) makes use of various standard libraries. A minimal list is provided in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file. If you are a pip user, please use the following command to install these libraries:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

For conda users:

```sh
conda install requirements.txt
```

**Note about version dependency**: although the requirements file specifies version dependencies to be exact, this is to err on the side of caution. For most modules (e.g. `numpy` or `scikit-learn`), a more recent version should work too and we are not aware of any version specific dependency on the functioning of KNN-D(ML). If you wish to avoid version-related complications, you may try using the following command instead. This does not impose a version requirement on any module and will either use the version you currently have, or else download the latest one from the pip repository in case you dont have a certain module.

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements_noversion.txt
```

## Reproducing results in the accompanying paper

The repository contains python scripts implementing various calibration algorithms and supporting code. However, a Jupyter notebook [experiments.ipynb](experiments.ipynb) implements an easily accessible wrapper that can be used to reproduce some of the results reported in the accompanying paper [[1]][ref1] on two datasets that are also included in this repository. Please refer to the last section of the notebook **Final Results**

**Note**: please note the following while attempting to reproduce results of the accompanying paper
1. While 12 datasets were used to produce results in the paper, only 2 of those, namely DD1(Jun) and DD1(Oct), are provided as a part of this repository in the directory [data/](data/). Only results relying only on these two datasets can be reproduced.

1. The calibration algorithms rely on train-test splits to obtain an unbiased estimate of the performance of various calibration algorithms. If you wish to reproduce the results in the paper, please use the train-test splits supplied for the 2 datasets DD1(Jun) and DD1(Oct) in the directory [perm/](perm/). The routines included in the repository also allow fresh train-test splits to be created. However, minor differences are to be expected in the results if fresh splits are used to conduct the experiments.    

1. The ranking and win-matrix results included in the notebook do not reproduce those in the accompanying paper (e.g. Table 3 and Table 5). This is because results in the paper are averaged over 12 datasets whereas those in the notebook use only 2 of those datasets, namely DD1(Jun) and DD1(Oct) (which are provided as a part of this repository).
